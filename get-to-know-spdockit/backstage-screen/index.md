The Backstage Actions view is a set of commands that can be used to quickly approach major SPDocKit options.

The following options are available:

* __Take Snapshot__ button loads SharePoint farm data if an on-premises farm is detected. This option is only available on SharePoint servers.
* __View Snapshots__ button will take you to all your saved snapshots, and you can select any of them to open and view data.
* __Compare Wizard__ button starts the compare wizard that allows you to compare farms, Web applications, site collections, web config files and permissions.
* __Options__ button gives you access to configuration options for adjusting SPDocKit to your needs.
