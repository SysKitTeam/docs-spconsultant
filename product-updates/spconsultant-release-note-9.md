* Fixed an issue where differences were falsely indicated when comparing Service Applications Administrators.
* Fixed an issue where the snapshot backup files were visible when browsing snapshot files to open in SPDocKit Consultant.
* Fixed a bug where the app would crash when trying to import a snapshot with the lower case extension ‘spdfarmx’ instead of the regular ‘SPDFarmx’ version. The import now supports both options.
