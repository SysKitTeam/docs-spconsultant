This section describes how you can generate SharePoint farm documentation using SPDocKit.

1. Navigate to the __Backstage Actions Screen__ and click the __View Snapshots__ button to view all of your snapshots. Double click the snapshot to open it and navigate to the [Farm Explorer](#internal/get-to-know-spdockit/farm-explorer-screen/farm-explorer-reports). If you navigate to the Farm Explorer without opening a snapshot the newest snapshot will be opened automatically. 

1. Click __Generate__ from the left-side navigation pane and select the format in which you wish to create your farm documentation. The available formats are __.doc, .pdf and .xlsx__.

1. The farm settings you want to export can be selected from the drop-down options.

    The selection you make can be saved and used as a template for generating documentation in the future. SPDocKit comes with predefined documentation templates, with commonly used options already pre-selected. 

   The documentation templates available by default are: __All, Regular Documentation or Simple Documentation.__ Use the Up and Down arrows to rearrange the order of your documentation.

1. The __Document Outline__ tab displays how the table of contents of your document will look.

1.  With the Options tab you can choose whether [Passwords and Product Keys](#internal/get-to-know-spdockit/farm-explorer-screen/password-and-product-keys/)  will be displayed in the generated document. If these were not defined, the check box will be disabled.

1. Click the __Generate__ button, wait a few moments and your SharePoint farm documentation will be generated!
