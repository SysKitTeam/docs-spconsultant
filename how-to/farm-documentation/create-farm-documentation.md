# Create Farm Documentation

This section describes how you can generate SharePoint farm documentation using SPDocKit.

1. Navigate to the **Backstage Actions Screen** and click the **View Snapshots** button to view all of your snapshots. Double click the snapshot to open it and navigate to the [Farm Explorer](../../get-to-know-spdockit/farm-explorer-screen/farm-explorer-reports.md). If you navigate to the Farm Explorer without opening a snapshot the newest snapshot will be opened automatically.
2. Click **Generate** from the left-side navigation pane and select the format in which you wish to create your farm documentation. The available formats are **.doc, .pdf and .xlsx**.
3. The farm settings you want to export can be selected from the drop-down options.

   The selection you make can be saved and used as a template for generating documentation in the future. SPDocKit comes with predefined documentation templates, with commonly used options already pre-selected.

   The documentation templates available by default are: **All, Regular Documentation or Simple Documentation.** Use the Up and Down arrows to rearrange the order of your documentation.

4. The **Document Outline** tab displays how the table of contents of your document will look.
5. With the Options tab you can choose whether [Passwords and Product Keys](../../get-to-know-spdockit/farm-explorer-screen/password-and-product-keys.md) will be displayed in the generated document. If these were not defined, the check box will be disabled.
6. Click the **Generate** button, wait a few moments and your SharePoint farm documentation will be generated!
