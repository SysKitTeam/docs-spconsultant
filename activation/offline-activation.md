## description: This article outlines the steps needed to perform an offline SPDocKit Consultant activation. Use this type of activation in case your SharePoint servers are not connected to the internet.

The Consultant license can be activated on any server, but you need to have a valid SPDocKit Consultant subscription. Please take special care that the Consultant license is intended for external \(customers' farms\) usage only. Here is how to activate a Consultant license offline.

1. From the left navigation bar on the **Backstage Screen** select **Help** and click on the **License Details** section to begin the activation process.
2. Click on the **Offline Activation** link and a new activation dialog will appear. Follow these steps:
   * Click on the **Generate** button to generate a **License Details \(.dlic\) file**.
   * Navigate to the [Activation Page](https://my.syskit.com/activation/?P=SPDocKit) and select **Consultant License** activation option.
   * Select the **Version** of SPDocKit you are creating a license for.
   * On the Activation Page, login with your username and password. You need to use the same email and password that you received during your online purchase. [Contact us](https://www.syskit.com/company/contact-us/) if you do not have the activation information.    
   * Upload the **License Details \(.dlic\) file**.
   * Click on **Generate license file!**.
   * Download the **license file \(.lic\)**.
3. Click on the **Browse** button, locate your license file and upload it.
4. Click the **Activate** button. Activation takes a couple of seconds and is a one time process.
   * The **license file \(.lic\)** is **only valid** for the user account and server where the **License Details \(.dlic\) file** was generated in step 2.

**Please note!** The Consultant license file is valid for 72 hours from the time of generation.
