The Consultant license can be activated on any server, but you need to have a valid SPDocKit Consultant subscription. Please take special care that the Consultant license is intended for external (customers' farms) usage only. Here is how to activate a Consultant license offline.

1. From the left navigation bar on the __Backstage Screen__ select __Help__ and click on the __License Details__ section to begin the activation process.
2. Click on the __Offline Activation__ link and a new activation dialog will appear. Follow these steps:
    * Click on the __Generate__ button to generate a __License Details (.dlic) file__.
    * Navigate to the [Activation Page](https://my.syskit.com/activation/?P=SPDocKit) and select __Consultant License__ activation option.
    * Select the __Version__ of SPDocKit you are creating a license for.
    * On the Activation Page, login with your username and password. You need to use the same email and password that you received during your online purchase. [Contact us](https://www.spdockit.com/support/contact-us/) if you do not have the activation information.    
    * Upload the __License Details (.dlic) file__.
    * Click on __Generate license file!__.
    * Download the __license file (.lic)__.
3. Click on the __Browse__ button, locate your license file and upload it.
4. Click the __Activate__ button. Activation takes a couple of seconds and is a one time process.
    * The __license file (.lic)__ is __only valid__ for the user account and server where the __License Details (.dlic) file__ was generated in step 2.


__Please note!__ The Consultant license file is valid for 72 hours from the time of generation.
