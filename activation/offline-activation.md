# Offline Activation

The Consultant license can be activated on any workstation, but you need to have a valid SPDocKit Consultant subscription. Please take special care that the Consultant license is intended for consultant's usage only. 

Here is how to activate a Consultant license offline:

1. From the left navigation bar on the **Backstage Screen** select **Help** and click on the **License Details** section to begin the activation process.
2. Click on the **Offline Activation** link and a new activation dialog will appear. Follow these steps:
   * Click on the **Generate** button to generate a **License Details \(.dlic\) file**.
   * Navigate to the [Activation Page](https://my.syskit.com/activation/?P=SPDocKit) and select **Consultant License** activation option.
   * Select the **Version** of SPDocKit you are creating a license for.
   * On the Activation Page, login with your username and password. You need to use the same email and password that you received during your online purchase. [Contact us](https://www.syskit.com/company/contact-us/) if you do not have the activation information.    
   * Upload the **License Details \(.dlic\) file**.
   * Click on **Generate license file!**.
   * Download the **license file \(.lic\)**.
3. Click on the **Browse** button, locate your license file and upload it.
4. Click the **Activate** button. Activation takes a couple of seconds and is a one time process.
   * The **license file \(.lic\)** is **only valid** for the user account and server where the **License Details \(.dlic\) file** was generated in step 2.
