# Online Activation

The Consultant license can be activated on any workstation, but you need to have a valid SPDocKit Consultant subscription. Please take special care that the Consultant license is intended for consultant's usage only.

Here is how to activate a Consultant license online:

1. From the left navigation bar on the **Backstage Screen**, select **Help** and click on the **License Details** section to begin the activation process.
2. On the activation screen choose the **Consultant** option. Fill in the **Email** and **Password** fields.

   You need to use the same email and password that you received during your online purchase. [Contact us](https://www.syskit.com/company/contact-us/) if you do not have the activation information.

3. Click the **Activate** button to start the activation process. Activation takes a couple of seconds and it needs to be repeated on every server you choose to activate. You can activate your license on an unlimited number of customers' servers while your subscription is active.
